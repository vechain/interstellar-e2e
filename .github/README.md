# interstellar-e2e

End-to-end tests for the VeChain **INTERSTELLAR** fork, which activates at block 1 in the test network.

## EIPs covered

| Folder | EIP | Description |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| `tests/eip5656` | [EIP-5656](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-5656) | `MCOPY` opcode (0x5e) for in-memory copying |
| `tests/eip7825` | [EIP-7825](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7825) | Per-transaction gas limit cap (`MaxTxGasLimit = 1 << 24`) |
| `tests/eip7934` | [EIP-7934](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7934) | Max RLP-encoded block size (`MaxRLPBlockSize = 8_388_608`); packer-level split test + P2P consensus-level rejection of oversized blocks |
| `tests/eip7883` | [EIP-7883](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7883) | ModExp precompile repricing |

## Prerequisites

- Go 1.26+
- A local checkout of [`vechain/thor`](https://github.com/vechain/thor) as a sibling of this repo (required by `go.work` until the INTERSTELLAR changes are published as a tagged release)

```

└── thor/
```

## Running the tests

```bash
make test
```

This builds the network binary, starts a 3-node local network, runs all test packages against it, then stops the network. On the first run, ThorBuilder clones and compiles thor — this can take ~15 minutes. Subsequent runs reuse the cached binary.

To run a single EIP package during development:

```bash
go test -v ./tests/eip7883/...
go test -v ./tests/eip7934/...
```

This starts its own network automatically (no `make` needed).

## Makefile targets

| Target | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `make test` | Build, start network, run all tests, stop |
| `make build-network` | Compile the network binary to `/tmp/interstellar-network` |
| `make stop` | Stop a running network |
| `make status` | Show running network nodes and health |
| `make clean` | Stop network and remove binary + state file |

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `NODE_URL` | Skip network start and use this node URL directly |
| `NODE_P2P_PORT` | Passed automatically by `make test`; set it manually only for P2P-based tests such as `tests/eip7934` when `NODE_URL` points to an already-running external node |
| `THOR_EXISTING_PATH` | Use a pre-built thor binary instead of building from source |
| `THOR_REPO` | Override the thor Git repo URL (default: `https://github.com/vechain/thor`) |
| `THOR_BRANCH` | Override the thor branch (default: `pedro/eip-7883`) |

## Pre-fork / post-fork testing

Each EIP test uses `InspectClauses` with a block revision to test behaviour on both sides of the fork boundary without mining new blocks:

- `Revision("0")` — genesis block, INTERSTELLAR not yet active
- `Revision("1")` — block 1, INTERSTELLAR active

EIP-7825 and EIP-7934 are exceptions: their checks are enforced on transaction submission/packing paths, not by `InspectClauses`, so those tests send real transactions and assert submission/inclusion behaviour. EIP-7934 additionally tests the **consensus-layer** rejection path by connecting to a node via devp2p and sending a validly-signed block whose RLP size exceeds the limit.
